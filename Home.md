I love computer science for all its application to the world right now. I am so excited to see where this degree takes me and what jobs I will do in the future!

Being behind a lens is often scoffed at, I think photography has taught me to appreciate life more than anything else. To capture a moment in time to remember forever, even when your memory fails, that is the best feeling while being a photographer.

Frisbee is one of the most taxing sports I've had the chance of playing in my life, but I wouldn't give it up for anything. I strive to get better everyday, hydrate all day!
