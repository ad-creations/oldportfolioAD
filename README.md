   <p>Being behind a lens is often scoffed at, I think photography has taught me to appreciate life more than anything else. To capture a moment in time to remember forever, even when your memory fails, that is the best feeling while being a photographer.</p>

     <p>Basically this week I structed out the skeleton of what I want my portfolio to be, I also drew lots of physical designs which I am not sure how to upload none google img urls to html via href links so I will just be trying to attach those on canvas. I didn't really get into a whole lot of tutorials that were on the canvas, but I did work on a bunch of <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/" target = "_blank"> freecodcamp </a> lessons and I am working towards the certification hopefully will have it by the end of the second week!</p>

     <p> There is a lot I want to do, a lot of tutorials I want to work on, and keep adding to my portfolio so that I can have it on my resume for people to look at when I apply to jobs, I want to figure out how to upload images not with urls, need to figure out styling and importing text styles, and I just want to do more tutorials on the canvas page! This week has been hectic so I haven't gotten nearly as much as I would have liked done so, whoever is grading this get excited for next week!</P>
