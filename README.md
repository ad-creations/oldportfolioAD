### Updates:
Change Log:
  
  Date 9/30 - I finally figured out a work around for css and styling into my html code, I am definetly confused from the amount of tutorials and different directions we were instructed to go for this project so please take this work with a grain of salt. Things I have done since the last milestone were, all my html work, made a nav bar, footers, all the files, really just get how pages works a bit better now, I feel if I was given an additional week I really could have brought into play the javascript, and react I learned this week. Really sad I couldn't incorparate my react use, I think it would have been a great addition into my photography page, I would have loved to make it into a fun interactive photo gallery. But whats done is done, shit happens.
      
To Do:
  
  Honestly there is still a lot I will be working on if I have spare time in the future. I broke half the stuff I made and then half the new stuff I put actually works. I really would love to incoporate more javascript when deploying my html, and using react more for my photos, and just markdown setup. Just dipping my toes into everything, its been a lot, and I know this isn't my best work, but I am excited to continue learning from my mistakes and just learning how to do better work.
