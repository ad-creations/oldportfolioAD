## Updates:
  ### Change Log:
  
  Date 9/23 - Basically did a whole rework of the markdown system that I had originally setup in the first week. Taught myself a lot of CSS, HTML, and just general GITHub management. Addtionally I figured out how to upload images finally, the work is a little slow going as I had Covid for the last week and was really struggling to recover.
      
  ### To Do:
  
  For Final Submission - I really want to incorpoate some react, and type script into my portfolio, but its gonna be a process, hoping for a wonderful turnout over the next week or so but I have a lot to make up for while being sick, not just for this class but my others as well. Wish me luck!
