      <p>Watchdogs: 2021</p>
      <p>This past summer I played for a club team named watchdogs, it was my first time playing on an adult club team. Was a good intro into adult club and will be trying out for higher level teams next summer! Watchdogs made it to regionals after going 6-1 at sectionals.
